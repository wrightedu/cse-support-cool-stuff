# Console.dev

[console.dev](https://console.dev/) is a free, weekly newsletter that helps you discover new development tools!

From [their website](https://console.dev/about/):

```
Console aims to become the place developers go to find the best tools. Starting as a weekly newsletter, each week we will pick out the most interesting tools and new releases. We keep track of everything - dev tools, devops, cloud, and APIs - so you don’t have to.

Our recommendations are made through years of experience and research, bringing a deep practical understanding of the needs of experienced developers. We pride ourselves on being transparent in our editorial approach. It’s our job to do the filtering, so you can stay up-to-date with the tools that matter, and focus on what you do best. Building.
