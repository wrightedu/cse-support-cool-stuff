# cse-support-cool-stuff
Just a collection of cool stuff collected by the CSE Support team and other folks at Wright State 

## Contributing

For third party programs, just add a short description in this readme with a link to the download page. For particularly cool looking software, feel free to add a screenshot stored in the `screenshots/` directory.

For programs that you wrote put a short description in this readme file and then stick the source code et all in a nicely named directory in the root of the project. If you want to provide a long readme, put it in this directory. For any short little programs that you feel don't require their own separate directory, use the `quickLilPrograms/` directory. If you already have a GitHub repo for the project, feel free to set it up as a sub-module.

Just as a general rule of thumb, all software and tools here should be useful, interesting, or just fun. Insert the usual disclaimer about legality, academic integrity, and university policy.
